__*Agoseris heterophylla* and *Trifolium albopurpureum* among annual grasses in rocky serpentine grassland near site 745__

## Overview: 

This is an R data package with vascular plant cover and density at 24 study sites located across the [University of California Sedgwick Reserve](https://sedgwick.nrs.ucsb.edu/) in Santa Barbara County, California. These sites are the focus of demographic and community functional trait studies in the [Kraft Lab at UCLA](https://sites.lifesci.ucla.edu/eeb-kraft/).     

![Map of 24 Sites](man/figures/README-sedgwick_map.png)
__Sedgwick Map:__ A) Map of all 24 sites across the reserve--only the lower sites are labeled. Sites labeled 740 to 763. B) Inset showing locations of upper sites.
<!--sites mapped with the data-raw/map_sedgwick_ggmap.R script --> 

## Installation

You can install sedgwickcover from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("akleinhesselink/sedgwickcover")
```

## Usage

`library(sedgwickenv)` will load the following datasets:

* __site_cover_2019__: dataframe with average cover and total abundance of vascular plants at each of the 24 sites in the spring of 2019 
* __plot_cover_2019__: dataframe with cover and density of vascular plants in 5 sampling plots at each of the 24 sites in the spring of 2019
* __site_cover_2017__: dataframe with average cover of vascular plants at each of the 24 sites in the spring of 2017 
* __plot_cover_2017__: dataframe with cover of vascular plants in 5 sampling plots at each of the 24 sites in the spring of 2017 
* __microplot_cover_2017__: dataframe with cover of vascular plants in 2 microplots nested within each fo the 5 sampling plots at each of the 24 sites in the spring of 2017
